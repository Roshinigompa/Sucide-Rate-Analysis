# Suicide Rate Analysis Project Readme

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the Suicide Rate dataset obtained from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 175. The data provides information on death rates due to suicide, categorized by sex, race, Hispanic origin, age, and year in the United States. The dataset is freely available for download from (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/death-rates-for-suicide-by-sex-race-hispanic-origin-and-age-united-states-020c1/resource/3e3345d3-5759-445c-aa2f-9bfc6891bd6b).

## Data Source

**Data Source Location:** Imported from the web as a CSV file.

**Data Discovery:** Discovered on (https://data.gov/) during a search for suicide rate analysis datasets. The dataset was chosen due to its relevance and alignment with the objectives of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) project.

**Legal and Free Access:** The data is legal to access, and it is freely available for download.

**EDA Documentation:** No documented EDA is available for the data, making it an ideal candidate for exploration.

## Objectives

1. **Gender Analysis:** Determine which gender (men or women) has a higher incidence of suicides.

2. **Age Analysis:** Identify the age group more susceptible to suicide.

3. **Yearly Trends:** Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of suicides over the years.

4. **Hispanic Origin Analysis:** Analyze suicide rates based on Hispanic origin.

5. **Gender and Hispanic Origin Analysis:** Further explore suicide rates by considering both gender and Hispanic origin.
